# Sequential 2.6.0 (2024-09-07).

Sequential is an image and comic viewer for macOS. It can display images
in folders, PDF files, and archives of these formats: ZIP CBZ RAR CBR 7z.

This is a modernized build of Sequential for Intel and Apple Silicon Macs
running 10.14 (Intel) or 11.4 (Apple Silicon) or later.

This version contains bug fixes and some feature improvements such as the
ability to go to a specific page number, the ability to invert the
colors displayed (useful for reading text-based PDF documents in Dark
Mode), and the ability to reset the displayed image's free rotation.

To see the release notes for this version, please read the
[History](History.txt) file.

There will probably not be any further changes or improvements to this
program because of limited free time and no strong desire to improve the
program any further.

There are parts of the application which probably wonâ€™t work properly
(HTML URLs may not display correctly) and it may have bugs and crashes.
Caveat emptor. For folders, PDFs and archives, the application works well.

The codebase (and its dependencies) have been updated to build with Xcode
14.2. Sequential is now built as an Universal app and has been tested on
macOS 10.14.5 (on an Intel Mac) and macOS 12.7.6 (on an Apple Silicon Mac).

- to distribute the built app:

[1] select Product -> Archive in Xcode then copy the archive to a staging folder, eg,
    ~/Sequential_staging

[5] rename the staging folder to include the release date/time:

% mv ~/Sequential_staging ~/Sequential\ 2021-08-04\ 15.27.00

[6] create an archive of the renamed staging folder:

% tar -c -v -J -H -f ~/Sequential.app.2021-08-04.15.27.00.tar.xz ~/Sequential\ 2021-08-04\ 15.27.00
