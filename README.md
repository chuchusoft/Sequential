# Sequential 2.4.0 (2023-11-02).

Sequential is an image and comic viewer for macOS.

Sequential can displays images in folders, PDF files, and archives of
these formats: ZIP CBZ RAR CBR 7z.

This is a modernized build of Sequential for Intel and Apple Silicon Macs
running 10.14 (Intel) or 11.4 (Apple Silicon) or later.

To see the release notes for this version, please read the
[History](History.txt) file.

The last build came out in 2010 so this program needed some work to get it
to build and run on modern Macs. Several bugs have been fixed and some
feature enhancements have been added.

There are parts of the application which probably wonâ€™t work properly
(HTML URLs may not display correctly) and it may have bugs and crashes.
Caveat emptor. For folders, PDFs and archives, the application works well.

The codebase (and its dependencies) have been updated to build with Xcode
14.2. Sequential is now built as an Universal app and has been tested on
macOS 10.14 (on an Intel Mac) and macOS 11.7.1 (on an Apple Silicon Mac).
