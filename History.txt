2.5.0 (2023-11-??)
- converted the codebase to build under Automatic Reference Counting (ARC);
  the codebase can still build under Manual Retain Release (MRR) but this will
  be removed later when all breaking changes have been fixed.
- in the thumbnail view, the selection color of selected siblings and parents
  of the active (displayed) item is now distinct from that of the active item.
- when multiple documents are open, the thumbnail view is now drawn using the
  correct system highlight colors for the main (active) window and inactive
  windows.
- when you click on a thumbnail folder that is not a parent of the currently
  displayed image and then click back to the thumbnail folder that is the
  parent of the currently displayed image, the thumbnail of the currently
  displayed image is now selected and the thumbnail is scrolled into view.
- the progress indicators shown in the Info window are now flipped: the current
  folder progress is now shown by the white knob while the entire document's
  progress is now shown by the background color bar.
- in the Info window, both the progress bar and the progress knob are always
  drawn even if the document has no inner containers (such as folders,
  archives, or PDF files); this reverses the change made in version 2.4.0
  which would only draw the progress bar and not the knob when the document
  has no inner containers.
- when not in fullscreen, it's now possible to hide the title bar of the window
  to have the image be drawn in the title bar area. The View menu has a new
  menu item named "Use Entire Window" which can toggle between hiding the
  title bar and showing it. The keyboard shortcut for this command is option-F.
  There is also a blue circle button widget on the right side of the title bar
  that can also toggle the title bar (it performs the same operation as the
  menu item). It is disabled when the window is in macOS fullscreen mode.
  The mouse pointer can be moved to the title bar area to temporarily show the
  close/miniaturize/zoom buttons, the document name/title, and toggle button.
  Important: the window can not be moved while the title bar is hidden.
  The same menu item changes to "Use Entire Screen" when in fullscreen to have
  the image drawn in the notch area on screens with a notch (it does nothing
  if a notch is not present). The keyboard shortcut is the same: option-F.
- added a standard macOS Full Screen menu item (shortcut: ctrl-command-F or
  fn-F). The Sequential Full Screen menu item is now labelled
  "Enter Full Screen (Sequential)" to make it clear which is which.
- updated XADMaster library to v1.10.8 (used to navigate and decompress
  archives)

2.4.0 (2023-11-02)
- PDF image drawing was being cached in a layer which resulted in a sub-optimal
  rendering appearance on high-DPI screens; now, PDF image drawing is no longer
  cached and is instead drawn directly to the backing store (which the macOS
  Window Server will then display on the screen). On review, it was decided
  that all image drawing should not be cached because AppKit is optimised to
  draw correctly and efficiently on high-DPI screens. As a result, the entire
  drawing code was made simpler by removing the layer caching entirely. PDF
  images should appear noticeably better on high-DPI screens. For non-PDF
  images, no degradation in image quality should occur but they are also now
  subject to bitmap caching by AppKit (this appears to help drawing performance
  when the image is repeatedly drawn).
- thumbnails and main images were being generated separately which resulted in
  the compressed image data being read and decompressed twice. The images are
  now read and decompressed once to generate both images.
- the number of cached images per document was increased. This improves the
  app's performance when navigating forwards and backwards because (much) fewer
  images need to be decompressed repeatedly.
- in the thumbnail view, PDF files are now displayed with the thumbnail of the
  first page in the file instead of a generic PDF icon.
- the byte file size of a PDF or archive is now shown on the thumbnail (it was
  not always being shown); [the code now tests for a typeCode of 'fold'].
- the size of the children in a disk folder is now correctly shown on the
  thumbnail [disk folders now return a typeCode of 'fold'].
- improved the drawing of the current folder progress bar in the Info window.
- the full-progress knob in the Info window is now drawn as an anti-aliased
  rounded rectangle at fractional locations.
- the current folder progress bar is no longer drawn if the document has no
  inner containers (such as folders, archives, or PDF files).
- added ability to display the contents of split 7-zip archives which must
  have the .7z.001 file extension for the first part.
- when an archive/PDF file/folder is moved or renamed, its entry in the Open
  Recent sub-menu is now updated to its new location or name, and the document
  window's title bar icon/name is updated (command-clicking the window title
  text will show the updated location/name).
- when an archive/PDF file/folder is trashed or deleted, its entry in the Open
  Recent sub-menu is now removed.
- fixed: opening a single image was not working.
- changed the distribution method from embedding the app inside the RTFd (*) to
  including a way for the user to remove the quarantine attribute by using an
  AppleScript source file that can be exported to create a drag and drop
  utility app. Instructions for creating this utility app and using it are in
  the "HOWTO remove the Sequential application from quarantine.rtfd" file.
  Instructions are provided by using screen shots and screen grab videos.
  (*) the previous distribution method no longer works in recent versions of
  macOS so the end user must now remove the app from quarantine to be able to
  open it.

2.3.0 (2023-10-15)
- when in fullscreen mode with thumbnails displaying, the app would crash when
  multiple archive/PDF documents were opened because it was trying to perform
  thumbnail updates using the wrong document's data. Fixed. Similar bugs were
  fixed if you switched active documents while in fullscreen mode with the
  thumbnails showing, as well as showing/hiding the thumbnails while in
  fullscreen mode.
- added support for several modern image file types: webp, heic, heif.
- shift-clicking in the thumbnail list now extends the selection (instead of
  adding the clicked-on item to the selection and nothing else).
- option-clicking a container in the thumbnail list (such as a folder or
  archive) now selects all of that container's (direct) viewable children.
- closing and switching between opened ZIP archives (via cmd-`) is now faster.
- moved the thumbnail preferences to their own pane named Thumbnail.
- files and containers can showing names and/or sizes (set in the Thumbnail
  pane of the Preferences window).
- containers in the thumbnail list can now show sizes in base 2, base 10, or
  in bytes (set in the Thumbnail pane of the Preferences window).
- in the thumbnail list, folders which have no images in them but which have
  folders that do contain images in them will now show the total size (if
  enabled in the preferences) of all of the images inside that folder with the
  total displayed inside square brackets, e.g., [123.45MB].
- the modification date for entries in an archive was not made available for
  sorting, etc. Fixed.
- the creation date for entries in an archive was not being correctly accessed.
  Fixed.
- an error dialog was presented when images were attempted to be saved to the
  folder offered in the Save dialog (ie, when a different folder is not
  navigated to). Fixed.
- when images are saved from an archive to a folder, the saved image files now
  have their creation and modification dates set to the value that is stored in
  the archive (if any).
- if a single folder is selected without any image being selected, changing the
  sort ordering would cause the thumbnail view of the folder's contents to be
  removed from the list of thumbnail views, which is different behavior from
  when a single folder is clicked (the contents are shown). Fixed: the contents
  are now shown after the sort is completed.
- when thumbnails are displayed, the Select All command now selects all siblings
  of any selected images. If a folder is selected, the Select All command selects
  all of its direct children. Only viewable images are selected; folders and
  non-viewable files are not selected.
- revealing an image in an archive will now select the archive file in the
  Finder instead of attempting to open the archive file itself.
- the Info window is now drawn with a background bar which indicates the display
  progress within the currently displayed folder/container; the bar is drawn in
  the system background highlight color.
- when more than 1 image is selected, the selection's count and total size is
  displayed in a small information window shown at the top of the thumbnail list
  view which has the selected images. The format of the size is the format
  selected in the Thumbnail pane of the Preferences window.
- when switching from normal window to a Sequential fullscreen window (not to
  be confused with a macOS system fullscreen window) and vice versa, the set of
  selected images in the thumbnail view is now preserved (it was being lost in
  previous versions). However, if the other open documents have multiple
  selected images, their selection will be lost (only the active image will
  become selected) - it's due to the way Sequential performs transitions to and
  from its fullscreen mode.
- the thumbnail of a PDF file now displays the PDF's byte size if that option
  is enabled in the Preferences.
- added .JFIF (.jfif) to the list of supported image file extensions

2.2.2 (2023-08-17)
- the set of paused documents was being stored in the user defaults (preferences)
  store, but this makes the system (Foundation framework) generate multiple
  warnings that too much data was being stored. To silence the warnings, paused
  documents are now stored in a separate file. The saved values will be migrated
  from the user defaults to the new separate file when the app is first run.
- the background color chosen in the General Preferences window was not being
  stored in a format that could be used by the code which drew views. As a
  result, the color was not being used to draw the display window's background.
  Fixed.
- as a result of fixing the previous bug, the checkerboard preference now works
  correctly.
- the thumbnails of the currently displayed image (and its parent folders) are
  now drawn using the current system accent color for the background.
- the Inspector window now has a larger default size (it was clipping some
  property names).
- in the Inspector window, dates are now less ambiguous: the Date/Time property
  name is now displayed as "Date/Time (Created)", "Date/Time (Original)", and
  "Date/Time (Digitized)".
- in the Inspector window, date values are now displayed in a more human-readable
  format: instead of "2023:08:12 12:34:56", the date is displayed as
  "2023-08-12 12:34:56".
- in the Inspector window, a value which is an ordered list of values was being
  displayed as "(" because the list was not formatted correctly. Fixed.
- when a window is displayed in fullscreen mode, the image was being drawn on the
  entire screen, even if this caused the notch to obscure a part of the image.
  Now, when in fullscreen mode, the notch is detected and the image is not drawn
  in the area besides the notch; instead, it is drawn under the notch. This
  behavior can be changed by using the "Use Entire Screen When In Full Screen"
  command in the View menu; on screens which don't have a notch, this command
  does nothing; the keyboard shortcut is option-F.
- when an image is toggled from a normal window to a fullscreen window, the
  background of the window is now drawn in opaque black instead of the
  background color and pattern that is selected in the Preferences window. This
  matches the behavior of the system Preview app.
  This behavior can be changed by using the "Full screen background" setting in
  the General Preferences window.
- in the General Preferences window, added a preference for the background color
  source: Sequential can now use the color of the system's current appearance
  (theme) or a custom color chosen by the user.
- if a window is showing thumbnails and is changed from fullscreen to a normal
  window (or vice versa) before the thumbnails had been generated, the app would
  crash because the thumbnail view was trying to access a deallocated object. Fixed.
- when the thumbnails are displaying and you navigate to the next or previous image
  and you reach the end of the displayed thumbnails, the list of thumbnails would
  scroll to make the next image selected be in the center (vertically). In doing
  so, the list of thumbnails ends up scrolling more than necessary as you navigate
  through the images. Now, the thumbnails are scrolled so that the next thumbnail
  is shown at the top (when navigating to the next image) or at the bottom (when
  navigating to the previous image), which reduces the amount of scrolling that
  occurs in the thumbnail views. There is no preference to control this behavior.

2.2.1 (2023-04-30)
- the folder count and size text would not fully display on the thumbnail if the
  name displayed above it was short. Fixed.
- the cursor would disappear sometimes. Fixed.
- updated to build using Xcode 14.2.

2.2.0 (2022-11-05)
- Intel version: requires macOS 10.14 or later (only tested under 10.14;
  the app might work as far back as 10.6)
- Apple Silicon version: requires macOS 11.4 or later
- modernized the codebase by using newer APIs and removing the use of deprecated APIs
- numerous small bug fixes
- enhanced the thumbnail display with the ability to show the image count and the
  size of a folder's contents (1 level deep only)
- removed the dependency on the HMBlk framework
- built with newest versions of XADMaster and UniversalDetector and which are
  now linked statically (ie, embedded into the Seqential executable file instead
  of as separate Frameworks)
- distributed as a RTFD file to work-around the requirement for code signing and
  notarization
- source archive is distributed with the versions of XADMaster and
  UniversalDetector that were used to build the app
